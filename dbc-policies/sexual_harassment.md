# Dev Bootcamp student and guest Sexual Harassment Policy

### Applies to
This policy governs the behavior of students, alumni, and guests in the
Dev Bootcamp space and staff interacting with other staff, students,
alumni, and guests in the Dev Bootcamp space or otherwise representing
Dev Bootcamp.  The Bootcamp Education, Inc. Sexual Harassment policy
overrides anything in this policy.

## Quick version
Dev Bootcamp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment and
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, age, national origin or religion. We do not tolerate
harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
not appropriate at Dev Bootcamp, including talks.  Participants
violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave without a
refund at the discretion of Dev Bootcamp staff. Our anti-harassment
policy can be found at [below](#long-version)

## Long version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, national origin, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Dev Bootcamp alumni, employers, and guests are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dev Bootcamp Staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Dev Bootcamp; for students this means expulsion from the program with no refund; for others, this includes expulsion from or banning of the Dev Bootcamp space with no refund if applicable. 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of Dev Bootcamp Staff immediately. 

Dev Bootcamp Staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of their time at Dev Bootcamp.

Internal version for Dev Bootcamp Staff
This version is intended for internal use by the Dev Bootcamp Staff. It defines an example enforcement policy that can be tweaked to suit your organization style.

Warnings
Any member of Dev Bootcamp Staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates Dev Bootcamp’s anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to [insert email address/phone number/etc. here] as soon as practical. The report should include:
	•	Identifying information (name/affiliation) of the participant
	•	The time you issued the warning
	•	The behavior that was in violation
	•	The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
	•	The circumstances surrounding the incident
	•	Your identity
	•	Other people involved in the incident
	•	[Your guideline here]

Presentations
Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of Dev Bootcamp Staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.

Taking reports
When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by Dev Bootcamp Staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

Expulsion
A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:
	•	A [first/second/third/seventeenth] offense resulting in a warning from staff
	•	Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
	•	A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
	•	A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
	•	A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
	•	[Your guideline here]

Local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

Public statements
As a general rule, Dev Bootcamp Staff should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the event or incident.
In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.

Staff Transparency
Generally, Dev Bootcamp Staff or teachers should be notified of an incident after it happens and should discuss the action taken.  Those notified of the incident should keep details confidential unless told otherwise.  When appropriate the incident can be discussed with current Dev Bootcamp students as a teaching moment.  However, the victim should be consulted before open discussion and their wishes, particularly in terms of disclosure to other students, should always be respected.
