#### Pairing Partners

Double Pair Programming - we will break into teams of 4 to discuss and work on sudoku psuedocode (sudocode!), then split into new pairs of 2 to work on independent solutions, but with a group defined plan.

Students will be grouped during orientation to make sure each group folks who know how to play sudoku.
