## week 1

> “Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”

(other links below)

hints for speed:

- when reading
  - evaluate the book (authors, amazon reviews, etc)
  - scan the TOC for items of interest and general awareness
  - seek out and surf your curiosity
  - go for breadth over depth first, then commit to depth when value is obvious
  - assuming you find value, take high level notes and include text snippets and page numbers to help you revisit
- when watching videos
  - evaluate the video (authors, reviews, comments, views)
  - scan a TOC (if available) for items of interest and general awareness
  - look for speed controls (try 1.5x or 2x speed)
  - assuming you find value, take high level notes and include video timing to help you revisit


#### Ruby

- Eloquent Ruby
  - read part I (there are several chapters in part I)
- The Well Grounded Rubyist
- Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby
- Confident Ruby
- Humble Little Ruby Book

#### Algorithms

*NOTE, some of this content is very heavy on "the math".  if that makes you nervous just keep breathing and remember these people are humans, just like you, and at one time they worked very hard to understand some of the patterns of thought, speech and writing that look so easy for them now.*

the following are selected videos and chapters that should be maximally valuable with minimal mathy-madness

- [Plain English explanation of Big O notation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/487278/2836874)
- Stanford on Coursera - Algorithms: Design and Analysis ([part I](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/preview) & [part II](https://class.coursera.org/algo2-2012-001/lecture)) (video)
  - [why study algorithms? (4 mins)](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/20)
  - [about the course (17 mins)](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/21)
  - [guiding principles for analysis of algorithms (15 mins) ](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/4)
  - [intro to data structures (5 mins)](https://class.coursera.org/algo-004/lecture/61)
- Algorithm Design Manual
  - read chapter 2, especially sections 2.2 and 2.3, and focus your energy on making sense of figures 2.3 and 2.4 to build an intuition for Big O notation
  - scan chapters 3 and 4 to develop context for data structures, sorting and searching
  - the intro chapter also has a couple of good stories
  - and of course you'll scan the entire TOC, right?
  - [link to supplemental videos and slides](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/video-lectures/)
  - [solutions to selected problems](http://nbl.cewit.stonybrook.edu:60128/mediawiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_%28Second_Edition%29)
- Algorithms in a Nutshell

#### Learning

- Adaptive Motivation (article)
- Mindset
  - read the "adaptive motivation" article above before diving into this book, it's short and will give you a good overview
- Bene Brown on the power of vulnerability (video)
