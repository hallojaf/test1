### Weekends

#### Weekend 1

1. Take a look at the Portfolio Challenges below to level set your "minimum bar" for the week.

2. Consider setting a goal to finish all the challenges marked [core] from week 1.

3. Read Chapters 1 and 2 of "Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby"
You can access a copy of this on the Books Dropbox–or there is a hard copy on the bookshelf at DBC.  As you are reading chapter 2–Come up with your own object (like the author's bicycle) and try to apply each concept to your Object.

> Walk outside for a least 10 minutes. Find something beautiful and marvel that it exists and that you are lucky enough to enjoy it.  Breathe.

#### Portfolio Challenges

Portfolio challenges are intended to help you review and solidify core concepts from each week.  These challenges were designed to draw a clear line in answering the common student question:

> What is the bare minimum I need to know?

*By no means* should you see these challenges as **the high bar** for where you should be at the end of phase 1.

For the high bar, consider that some of our students [wrote and published their own gems](https://github.com/sandbochs/local_message) while still in phase 1, [wrote useful applications over the weekend between phase 1 and 2](http://www.codequizzes.com/), and went on to [generally change the world shortly thereafter](http://Devbootcamp/2013/08/19/how-dbcers-are-turning-your-browser-into-a-snake-playing-gosling-loving-wonderwolrd/).

What's your high bar?
