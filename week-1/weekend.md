## Week 1

### Weekend

##### Review and Solidify Learning

1. Review any unfinished core challenges from the week. Timebox 2-4 hours to get as far as you can to completion with them. If after this time they are still unfinished, reflect on how you want to allocate time to complete them.
1. Choose 3 problems from the week that you completed with a pair and that you struggled with.  Redo each of these challenges solo and try to understand the original approach or implement a new approach.
1. Complete the [Learning Competencies Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TFrLnRaO1Z1IOVeuqsyiAgI_50MaHNJtys-hDEUX0Hs/viewform).

##### Stretch Forward

1. Read Chapters 1 and 2 of [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](https://www.dropbox.com/s/82gx9sf00vmonad/Practical%20Object%20Oriented%20Design%20in%20Ruby.pdf)
You can access a copy of this on the [Books Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cyje5e6cfk708al/USop5LBSQA), or there is a hard copy on the bookshelf at DBC.  
As you are reading chapter 2, come up with your own object (like the author's bicycle) and try to apply each concept to your Object.

##### Reflect

It's really hard for smart, hard working, passionate people to admit when they don't get something. Our natural tendency is to guard our ignorance so that everyone thinks we're competent.

Effective developers expose their ignorance. Period.

Read the Apprenticeship Pattern on [exposing your ignorance](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#expose_your_ignorance) and answer the following questions in your own journal:

- When have you chosen not to expose your ignorance, and what impact did it have on your effectiveness?
- What are the 5 things you feel like you understand the least about computer programming? Try to keep it to stuff that you've tried to understand in the past.
- What is the way you feel most comfortable exposing your ignorance?

##### Set you High Bar 

1. The challenges provided during the week are a guide to start you on a learning path. *By no means* should you see these challenges as **the high bar** for where you should be at the end of phase 1.For the high bar, consider that some of our students [wrote and published their own gems](https://github.com/sandbochs/local_message) while still in phase 1, [wrote useful applications over the weekend between phase 1 and 2](http://www.codequizzes.com/), and went on to [generally change the world shortly thereafter](http://Devbootcamp/2013/08/19/how-dbcers-are-turning-your-browser-into-a-snake-playing-gosling-loving-wonderwolrd/).

**What's your high bar?**

#### Breathe

Walk outside for a least 10 minutes. Find something beautiful and marvel that it exists and that you are lucky enough to enjoy it.  Breathe.
