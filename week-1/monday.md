#### 3pm - 6pm - Pairing Partners

- 1 Hour Rotational Pairing
  - Share a team or pairing moment for 3 minutes each
  - Spend minimum of 10 minutes writing pseudocode (this is an amazing way to synch with your pair)
  - One person is navigator, one person is driver

- Switch Pairs after 1 Hour
  - Current Driver stays seated and switches to now being a Navigator
  - Current Navigator moves to new pair, becomes a Driver
  - Work with existing code base until working correctly
  - DO NOT start from scratch or do major refactoring unless absolutely necessary
  - Practice understanding a new code base and communicating with your pair to understand the logic
