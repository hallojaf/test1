#### 3pm - 6pm - Pairing Partners

- 1 Hour Rotational Pairing
  - Share a team or pairing moment for 3 minutes each
  - Spend minimum of 10 minutes writing pseudocode (this is an amazing way to synch with your pair)
  - One person is navigator, one person is driver

- Switch Pairs after 1 Hour
  - Current Driver stays seated and switches to now being a Navigator
  - Current Navigator moves to new pair, becomes a Driver
  - Work with existing code base until working correctly
  - DO NOT start from scratch or do major refactoring unless absolutely necessary
  - Practice understanding a new code base and communicating with your pair to understand the logic

### Notes

- Share your shortcuts. Learn your tools now. It'll pay dividends later
- Make sure your pair is "with you". If you react to something on the screen, spell out what you're reacting to like an error or whatever.
- Playing with a new idea or bit of syntax? Don't just talk about it, show it. who was I working with on the spaceship operator today? This thing: **<=>**
- Ask lots of questionsm but please don't expect a teacher or TA to *always* be there for you.  This isn't a restaurant! find a peer, a phase 4 student or a coach. Be bold in your search for answers.
- Be deliberate in your experiments. Who was I working with on exploring object_id today? What is that anyway? Why does it change with strings but not symbols?
- Take notes! Get a notepad at your side and make notes of new or confusing things. If you can't understand it on the spot, make sure to research later.
