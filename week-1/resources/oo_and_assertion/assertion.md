# Assertions
## what?
- [What is a test assertion?](http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/test-assertions)
- [what are assertions](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatAreAssertions)
- [why test](http://cs.gmu.edu/~offutt/classes/637/slides/Ch01-whyTest.pdf)

## how?
So many frameworks attempt to do that. The 2 popular ones in the ruby worlds are:

- [mini test](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)
- [rspec](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec)

We will be using Rspec starting week 3 and for the rest of your time at DBC and we will dive deeper into it in week 3. For now, we will focus on writing our own basic assertions. Clone the mini test code base (linked above) and look at the [assertions module](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/master/lib/minitest/assertions.rb). Start simple:

- Week 1: we will implement the following assertion methods:
	- assert
	- assert_equals
- Week 2: we will implement the following assertion methods:
	- assert_block
	- assert_empty
	- assert_includes
- Week 3: we will dive into Rspec
