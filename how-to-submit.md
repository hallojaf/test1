# How to Submit a Challenge

We will be using github to submit and review all challenges.  The standard github flow we will use is:

```
Step 1: Fork



**Do not (DO NOT) ever (EVER) merge a pull request into master. **

```


### Notes

- Share your shortcuts. Learn your tools now. It'll pay dividends later
- Make sure your pair is "with you". If you react to something on the screen, spell out what you're reacting to like an error or whatever.
- Playing with a new idea or bit of syntax? Don't just talk about it, show it. who was I working with on the spaceship operator today? This thing: **<=>**
- Ask lots of questions but please don't expect a teacher or TA to *always* be there for you.  This isn't a restaurant! find a peer, a phase 4 student or a coach. Be bold in your search for answers.
- Be deliberate in your experiments. Who was I working with on exploring object_id today? What is that anyway? Why does it change with strings but not symbols?
- Take notes! Get a notepad at your side and make notes of new or confusing things. If you can't understand it on the spot, make sure to research later.
