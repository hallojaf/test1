HOW TO BECOME A MORE CREDIBLE TEACHER

Trust

- Adapt messages for listeners by being sincere and honest in the presentation of information.

- Identify strengths and weaknesses in information - for example, reliability and bias - to demonstrate honesty.

- Introduce sources that are trusted by pupils and use them to develop class material.

- Explain the soundness of analysis, arguments and evidence.

- Earn trust by showing trust towards pupils.

Competence

- Appear highly organised in the presentation of the subject matter.

- Deliver a message that is as free from errors as possible, including grammar, pronunciation and enunciation.

- Prepare thoroughly by being in control of the subject matter, key issues, sources, evidence, arguments and differing viewpoints.

- Have lesson plans that are organised and detailed.

- Use relevant personal experiences to provide greater insights for students.

Dynamism

- Develop a powerful style of speaking that uses few verbal or vocal hesitancies such as “OK” or “you know”.

- Vary physical movements such as gestures, facial expressions and eye contact.

- Vary vocal characteristics, such as rate, pitch, inflection and tone.

- Use a variety of evidence, stories, visual aids and computer programs.

Immediacy

- Have a relaxed body position so that you look comfortable when standing or sitting in front of the class.

- Establish eye contact with the entire class.

- Smile to disarm and relax students.

- Attempt to reduce distance between yourself and students by moving or by moving away from barriers such as desks or lecterns.
