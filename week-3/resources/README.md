# Week 3 Resource Links


These are some links to potentially useful resources.  There is more information in the files in this folder.

If you find a resource that is missing, or one that is here but not useful, submit a pull request or an issue on github.  If you find yourself wanting to email a cool link to your cohort - check if it is here first and if not, add it!
