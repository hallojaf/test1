# Working Agreement

- We meet with our accountability buddies at 8:45am sharp every week day. (Text or call your buddies if they are not present. We won't start our meeting until all boots are accounted for.)
- Core hours are 9 to 6.  You should plan on being here working for that time.  Most days you will have lunch from 12:30-2:00 where you are free, but be sure to check the calendar for scheduled events / speakers during lunch
- We meet in the Cave every morning at 9 am sharp.
- We meet in the Cave every afternoon at 2 pm sharp.
- Our top priorities for this phase are:
  - Learning how to appropriately respond versus reactâ€¦ to error messages, challenges, and self talk.
  - Learning how to communicate what you're feeling, thinking, and needing.
  - Learning how to build and use mental models.
  - Seeking opportunities to help each other, grow as individuals, and as a tribe.
