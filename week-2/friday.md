In addition to just "solving the challenge", I want you to dedicate some time and effort to two essential skills that all software teams must have:

Managing product development with multiple collaborators using version control
Writing robust, well-structured, and flexible code which follows tried-and-true design patterns

## Collaborative Product Development

For the first skill, you will be using git and GitHub. Here is a bare-bones outline of one kind of [git workflow](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/43860f5056b4955750f6)

You can also check out this tutorial: http://try.github.io.

## Design Patterns

There are many, many different [software design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). The skill is not in applying the pattern, but in knowing when and why a particular pattern is useful.

To begin, we'll experiment with the [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern, which is widely used across a variety of platforms. [Jeff Atwood's post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/understanding-model-view-controller.html) does a good job of summarizing this pattern.

In addition, here are some other resources to take a look at (spoiler alert: these links contain solutions to the ToDo app challenge):
