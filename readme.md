### what is our working agreement?

- we meet in the Cave every morning at 9 am sharp (except Fridays for check-ins)
- we suggest that our top priorities for this phase be to:
  - learn how to respond and communicate appropriately (re: error messages, challenges, self talk)
  - seek opportunities to help each other, grow stronger as individuals and grow closer as a tribe
  - learn how to express our ideas using software by reading and writing code and speaking to others about it
  - learn how to optimize our own learning

*we can modify this working agreement as we move along*
