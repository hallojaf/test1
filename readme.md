### What is our working agreement?

- We meet every morning at 9 am sharp (except Fridays for check-ins)
- We suggest that our top priorities for this phase be to:
  - Learn how to respond and communicate appropriately (re: error messages, challenges, self talk)
  - Seek opportunities to help each other, grow stronger as individuals and grow closer as a tribe
  - Learn how to express our ideas using software by reading and writing code and speaking to others about it
  - Learn how to optimize our own learning

*we can modify this working agreement as we move along*
