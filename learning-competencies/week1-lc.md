# Learning Competencies: Phase 1 : Week 1 [Ruby]

* Competencies are broken into three stages of "mastery" using the *[Japanese concept of Shuhari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari)*.  

* Competencies are listed in [summary](#summary) and in [challenge specific](#challenge-specific-learning-competencies) form.

## Summary

### Understand principles of language structure and execution

**Shu**: I am aware of the basic components of programming (variables, conditionals, looping, methods, data types) and can identify each of them when reading a program.

**Ha**: I can write basic programs to solve for specific tests or evaluation conditions, e.g. "write a method `mean()` which takes an array of integers and returns the mean: `mean([3,6,8]) => 5.66667`.

**Ri**: I am fluent in the syntax of Ruby and am able to translate a verbal specification or user story into a functional  program.

### Write "driver code" to test and drive development

**Shu**: I understand that there are many reasons to "test" your code, and that a good sanity-check and guide for early stage development is writing "driver code" to provide explicit expectations.

**Ha**: I am able to build small test suites with descriptive output and clear indicators of passing tests.  My tests cover the majority of functionality of my code.

**Ri**: I can use "Error-Driven Development" to pre-define program behavior and guide development. 

### Debug methodically and effectively

**Shu**: I can do simple debugging and am aware that there are tools and methods for debugging and that the best programmers are the best debuggers.

**Ha**: I know a methodology for debugging: repeating the error, reading the error, Googling the error, following the stack trace, checking log files or printing to the console (visualize the state).

**Ri**: I can debug efficiently and effectively using a variety of tools: error logging, setting breakpoints, interacting with the console, effective research.

### Articulate algorithm design in multiple formats (pseudocode, image, verbal, plain english, etc.)

**Shu**: I understand the importance of abstracting an accurate mental model of a process, and using it as a map to develop a solution in code.

**Ha**: I understand how to arrive at an abstract model by breaking a problem down into it's constituent parts.

**Ri**: I am able to recognize the optimal format for can create abstract models that are optimized for a particular particular

## Challenge Specific Learning Competencies

As you work through the challenges, you will see these competencies.  When you complete a challenge, consider your level of understanding of each competency.  Competencies overlap and are on several challenges, so you may not fully grasp them until you have seen them many times. 

### Understand principles of language structure and execution

- Think creatively about problem solving and can identify and compare multiple solutions.
- Read a program and evaluate the code in my head, easily identifying areas of confusion or unknown tools/concepts.
- Build programs to satisfy a suite of test code.

### Write "driver code" to test and drive development

- Explain the difference between the "core" code of a program and code which exercises/evaluates that program.
- Create ruby statements that encapsulate an expectation and outputs a meaningful evaluation of methods and objects.
- Can infer the behavior and structure of code variables, methods, and objects accessed from driver (test) code
- Can define an expectation for a program or method and follow the methodical process of (Red, Green, Refactor) in TDD speak
- Can use EDD and TDD for developing incrementally and quickly reaching a stable minimum viable product.

### Debug methodically and effectively

- Identify where the error is, decipher the error message, and infer the likely source of the error
- Use puts statements to view variable states and method returns to decipher non-obvious bugs
- Know the solution to most common error messages,  and be able to explain succinctly why the error occurred
- Create a succinct description of an error that will yield accurate search results.
- Use a debugging tool to stop the program during runtime, access variable states, and step through line by line
- Use multiple different methods to zero in on non-obvious bugs (including debuggers, sniper commenting, consoles (sqlite, rails console), etc)

### Articulate algorithm design in multiple formats (pseudocode, image, verbal, plain english, etc.)

- I can recognize models that are accurate models for a problem and realize that models will always have a limitation in their approximation of the problem.
- Can abstract a pattern for a model after identifying repetition in code and relationships in data.
- Can choose appropriate test cases for a problem, and use them to create a more abstract general design.
- Translate between different modes of modeling 
- Identify edge cases that uncover the nuances of the problem, and test the efficacy of my models appropriately.
