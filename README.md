### What is our working agreement?

- We meet with our accountability buddies at 8:45am sharp every week day. (Text or call your buddies if they are not present. We won't start our meeting until all boots are accounted for.)
- We meet in the Cave every morning at 9 am sharp.
- We meet in the Cave every afternoon at 2 pm sharp.
- Our top priorities for this phase are:
  - Learning how to respond appropriately (vs. reactâ€¦ to error messages, challenges, and self talk)
  - Learning how to communicate (what you're feeling, thinking, and needing)
  - Learning how to build and use mental models
  - Seeking opportunities to help each other, grow as individuals, and as a tribe
